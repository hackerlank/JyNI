/**
 * To map native MethodDescriptor objects to Jython we need this simple
 * PyBuiltinCallable-implementation. Binding works by a native call.
 * This implementation is special in the sense that Java-side is a
 * PyObject while C-side - PyMethodDef - is not. We treat it mostly
 * like Java-side also wasn't and once a method is bound, we use
 * PyCFunction instead.
 * PyCFunction is also a PyBuiltinCallable, but stands for a native
 * PyCFunctionObject, which is an actual PyObject too.
